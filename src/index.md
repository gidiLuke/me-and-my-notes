My name is Lukas Heidegger and I like to build things. Preferrably, if these things are meaningful.

## Focus

- Systems design, architecture, and pragmatic engineering.
- Clear, long-lived solutions over short-lived trends.
- Building developer tools and internal platforms.

## About this website

I created this website initially end of 2025 on the train to Hamburg. My original intention was to have a place where I publicly think about dev related topics. It should be my personal knowledge base - but why not share it. I wanted to keep it super simple, but ended up adding a few "special" features. At least I had fun - I hope you enjoy them too.

*So here we are.*
