**Hello**, I’m Lukas and I like to build things. Preferably things that are meaningful.

Most of what I build lives at the intersection of software, systems, and the real world. I have strong desire to understand how things work, especially when they don’t.

If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be *curious*.
Curiosity is what pulls me into problems and keeps me there until they are properly understood. I enjoy complexity but value clarity and structure. 

My current focus is building data-centric and intelligent applications for Europe’s energy networks at **E.ON Digital Technology**. 
Technologies I work with regularly include:

- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** Azure, Terraform, OpenTofu, Docker
- **Data & AI/ML:** Databricks, MLflow, PyTorch
- **Backend & APIs:** Python, FastAPI
- **Frontend:** Plotly Dash, Streamlit
- **Engineering Practices:** Software Architecture, DevOps, DevEx

Tech I worked with in the past: Java, C/C++, C#, embedded hardware, electronics (PCB design and prototyping, soldering, diagnostics, ...), physical prototyping (3D printing, laser-cutting, waterjet-cutting, metal and wood works, welding, ...)

On my todo list: Rust


## About this website

I created this website initially end of 2025 on the train to Hamburg. My original intention was to have a place where I publicly think about dev related topics. It should be my personal knowledge base - but why not share it. I wanted to keep it super simple, but ended up adding a few "special" features. At least I had fun - I hope you enjoy them too.
