Welcome. This is a static, terminal-driven personal site focused on professional work, projects, and current focus.

## Quick start

Use the command prompt below to navigate. Examples:

- `cd /about`
- `cd /projects`
- `cd /blog`

## Focus

- Systems design, architecture, and pragmatic engineering.
- Clear, long-lived solutions over short-lived trends.
- Building developer tools and internal platforms.

## Longer note

I spend most days in the messy intersection between product intent and technical reality. That means
mapping vague outcomes into concrete systems, keeping scope crisp, and making trade-offs explicit so the
next person can follow the thread. I care about software that stays legible over time, with a bias toward
boring building blocks and sharp execution.

When I start a new project, I look for the small structural decisions that remove future drag: how data
flows, where ownership lives, and what the real dependencies are. If a design is easy to explain, it’s
usually easier to maintain. I also like fast feedback loops, especially for developer experience—small
tools and scripts that keep teams moving.

Outside of shipping, I keep notes on architecture, internal platforms, and the kind of engineering work
that compounds. This site is a scratchpad for that, plus a few experiments.

Some weeks are deep technical dives, other weeks are about aligning people and expectations. Both matter.
If you’re looking for a collaborator who can balance speed with clarity, you’ll probably find something
useful here.
